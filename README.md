The code implements a spam email classifier using a Naive Bayes model. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Data Loading: The dataset (spam.csv) containing email messages and their categories (spam or ham) is loaded.

Text Preprocessing:

Text is converted to lowercase.
Non-alphanumeric characters are removed.
The text is tokenized into words.
Stop words (common words like "the", "and") are removed, and stemming is applied (words are reduced to their root form).
Feature Extraction:

The preprocessed text is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization, which captures the importance of words across documents.
Model Training:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the training data to predict whether an email is spam or not.
Model Evaluation:

The classifier's performance is evaluated on the test set, with accuracy and classification metrics (precision, recall, etc.) being printed.
Model Saving:

The trained model and vectorizer are saved as .pkl files for later use.
This classifier helps detect spam emails based on message content.
