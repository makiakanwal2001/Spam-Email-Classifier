# Spam-Email-Classifier
The code creates a spam email classifier using Naive Bayes. It preprocesses text data by cleaning, tokenizing, and stemming. Then, it converts the text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. The model is trained on email data and evaluated for accuracy. Finally, both the trained model and vectorizer are saved for future use.
